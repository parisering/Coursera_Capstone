    "Los Angeles, California is home of the second-largest concentrated population of Filipinos in the world, only exceed by Manila. As this population continues to grow, many other filipinos within the United States are looking to find their little \"slice of home\" within the nation. With many filipino owned-businesses in this area such as restaurants, bakeries, and markets - this would be a wonderful trip for those looking to indulge in Filipino culture domestically, since international travel is unknown at the moment. \n",

This would include identifying areas with Filipino restaurants, bakeries, markets - and have hotels nearby. \n"
